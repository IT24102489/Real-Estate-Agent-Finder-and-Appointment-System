# Reviews & Ratings System Implementation

## Overview

This document details the implementation of the Reviews & Ratings component for the Real Estate Agent Finder and Appointment System. This component enables clients to leave reviews and ratings for real estate agents, providing valuable feedback to other potential clients.

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete reviews for agents
- Rate agents on a 5-star scale
- Sort reviews by date (newest first) or rating (highest first)
- Calculate average ratings for agents
- View all reviews or filter by specific agent

## Data Structures Used

### 1. Priority Queue

A custom priority queue implementation (`ReviewPriorityQueue`) was created to efficiently manage reviews based on different criteria:

- **Max Heap Implementation**: The underlying data structure is a max heap, represented as an ArrayList for dynamic sizing.
- **Configurable Sorting**: The priority queue can be configured to prioritize by:
  - Rating (highest first) - useful for finding top-rated reviews
  - Date (newest first) - useful for displaying most recent feedback
- **Time Complexity**:
  - Insertion: O(log n)
  - Retrieval of highest priority item: O(1)
  - Deletion of highest priority item: O(log n)

### 2. File-Based Storage

As per project requirements, data is stored using file operations instead of a database:

- Binary serialization for efficient storage and retrieval (`reviews.dat`)
- Human-readable text format for easier debugging and inspection (`reviews.txt`)

## Architecture

The implementation follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern:

### Model

- `Review.java`: Represents a review with properties such as id, agentId, reviewer information, rating, text, and timestamp
- `ReviewPriorityQueue.java`: Custom data structure for efficient review management

### Controller

- `ReviewDAO.java`: Data Access Object handling file operations and providing an interface to the data
- Servlets for handling HTTP requests:
  - `AddReviewServlet.java`: Handles creation of new reviews
  - `ListReviewsServlet.java`: Retrieves and displays reviews
  - `UpdateReviewServlet.java`: Modifies existing reviews
  - `DeleteReviewServlet.java`: Removes reviews

### View

- JSP pages for user interface:
  - `agentReviews.jsp`: Shows reviews for a specific agent
  - `addReview.jsp`: Form for submitting new reviews
  - `updateReview.jsp`: Form for editing existing reviews
  - `allReviews.jsp`: Displays all reviews in the system
  - `error.jsp`: Error handling page

## Object-Oriented Programming Concepts Applied

### 1. Encapsulation

- Data fields in model classes are private with public getter/setter methods
- Internal implementation details of the priority queue are hidden from consumers

### 2. Inheritance

- Servlets extend `HttpServlet` base class
- Review class implements `Serializable` for file storage and `Comparable` for natural ordering

### 3. Polymorphism

- Method overriding is used in servlets (doGet, doPost methods)
- Factory methods in `ReviewPriorityQueue` create differently configured instances

### 4. Abstraction

- High-level operations in DAO hide the complexity of file operations
- The priority queue abstracts the complexities of heap operations

## Algorithms

### 1. Heap Operations

The priority queue implements standard heap algorithms:

- **Heapify Up**: After adding a new review, restore the heap property by comparing with parents
- **Heapify Down**: After removing the highest priority review, restore the heap property by comparing with children

### 2. Sorting

- Custom comparators allow different sorting criteria (by date or rating)
- The `toSortedList()` method efficiently retrieves items in priority order

### 3. Filtering

- Agent-specific reviews are filtered using a dedicated method that creates a new priority queue

## User Interface

The UI is designed to be intuitive and responsive:

- **Star Rating System**: Visual representation of ratings using star symbols
- **Form Validation**: Required fields and proper input types for data integrity
- **Responsive Design**: CSS ensures usability across device sizes
- **Sorting Options**: Users can toggle between date and rating sort order
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Prevents accidental deletion of reviews

## Extensibility

The system is designed for easy extension:

- Additional sorting criteria can be added by creating new comparators
- The Review model can be extended with more fields if needed
- The priority queue implementation is generic enough to be used for other data types

## Conclusion

The Reviews & Ratings component provides a robust system for managing agent feedback, utilizing appropriate data structures and algorithms for efficient operation. The implementation follows object-oriented principles and provides a clean separation of concerns between data, logic, and presentation layers.
