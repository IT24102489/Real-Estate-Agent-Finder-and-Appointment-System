## Project Description

The Real Estate Agent Finder and Appointment System is a web-based application designed to help users efficiently search for real estate agents and book appointments with them. The system utilizes a Binary Search Tree (BST) to store and manage real estate agents, ensuring fast and efficient searching based on agent names. Additionally, it incorporates the Selection Sort algorithm to sort agents by their ratings, enabling users to find the highest-rated professionals easily.

## Features:

* Agent Management: Users can add, update, and remove agent records.

* Search Functionality: BST enables quick retrieval of agent details.

* Sorting Mechanism: Selection Sort is used to display agents based on ratings.

* Appointment Scheduling: Users can book, update, or cancel appointments with agents.

* User-Friendly Interface: UI enhancements using Tailwind CSS/Bootstrap.

## Technologies Used:

* Backend: Java Servlets and JSP

* Frontend: HTML, CSS (Tailwind/Bootstrap), JavaScript

* Development Environment: IntelliJ IDEA, Tomcat Server

* Data Storage: File handling (Read/Write operations) instead of a database

* Version Control: GitHub

## Object-Oriented Principles:

The system follows Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles such as:

Encapsulation (hiding data and exposing only necessary functionalities)

Inheritance (reusing existing code through class hierarchy)

Polymorphism (using method overriding for flexibility)

## Development Approach:

The project is developed using Java web technologies with GitHub version control for collaborative development.

A final report, class diagrams, and viva presentation are part of the project deliverables.
